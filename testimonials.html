            We turned to Luisa when we needed to renovate our main office.
            It worked out great.  She found the right answers and perfect balance for
            satisfying and delighting all the stakeholders involved.

            When clients visit, we can now put our best foot forward as we welcome them
            into our office.  Our team is also very happy with the new environment.

            Over the last 5 years Luisa has designed for me on several projects, including my
            medical offices, country home, lake home and currently we are working together to
            design my dream retirement home.
        </p>
        <p>
            As we began to work together, it didn’t take long for me to see how passionate she
            is about design.  She has a deep knowledge of architectural history, furnishings
            and design styles. She takes the time to explain the process and design principles
            as we go, even creating helpful conceptual drawings at key stages of the design to
            help me gain confidence in the direction of the project.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some of the best memories working with Luisa have been occasions when we lost track
            of time making improvements to the vision as Luisa drafted away and the meeting ran
            into the late evening.  I really felt like the custom designs came to life right in
            front of our eyes, and covered the needs of my lifestyle perfectly.
        </p>
        <p>
            When it comes to protecting the budget, Luisa is great to have in your corner.  On
            many occasions she was able to find common sense ways to save money, and never by
            sacrificing quality or beauty of the design.  Often the money saved in one area
            would allow me to take another area to the next level, something that really stood
            out as special.
        </p>
        <p>
            Luisa has been a fantastic designer and a great friend.  I can’t wait to see what
            the future brings as we complete the dream of my future retirement home.

            Luisa is the bee's knees.
        </p>
        <p>
            She is an extremely talented designer and has the amazing ability to understand
            what you want, make it better and make it happen with whatever budget you have.
            She's the type of person who will roll up her sleeves and will do whatever it
            takes to make sure that her work exceeds your expectations.
        </p>
        <p>
            Luisa worked on our office and EVERYONE that walks in is so impressed by what
            we did with it.  I would highly recommend her and can't wait to work with her
            on future projects!

            I highly recommend Luisa. She did a great job on my office space. Originally,
            I didn’t feel the need to do much in the way of “design” of my office. After
            a recommendation of her services from a friend, I had Luisa come in and show
            me examples of what she could do. I was surprised at how good she made it
            look. She made a good office look great. I personally feel better coming
            into the office that looks so good. She did a great job!

            I worked with Luisa on a staging project for a beautiful home I was selling.
            Luisa was amazing to work with.  For one thing she absolutely loves every minute
            of what she does and it shows up in her enthusiastic approach to each and every
            part of the process.  She really knows her stuff.  She knows periods, styles
            and she understands elements and principles of design, scale and balance,
            functionality and how to optimize space.  I would literally have been lost
            without her on this project.  On top of it all, she's a blast to work with
            AND she saved me a ton of money.  You will love her.  Thank you Luisa!!!

            We had the pleasure of working with LP Design Details to makeover and furnish
            our Plaza condominium.  Luisa provided her expertise all the way from paint
            colors, refurbishing of cabinetry and wood flooring, to furniture and accessories
            for our new home and lifestyle.  She adeptly blended our traditional style with
            the modern lines of our high rise condominium building style.  Of particular
            pride is the custom design and build entertainment center that is the focal
            point of our living area.  Luisa designed a unit with details that incorporated
            architectural elements from other furniture pieces in our home and secured a
            quality carpenter to build out her vision.  The end result exceeded
            our expectations.

            Luisa Patterson staged my home.  When my realtor stepped into my
            living room with the hardwood floors, the big mirror with the matching scones
            over the decorative fireplace, her mouth dropped open. She turned to me to say
            how surprised she was to see this kind of professional job. (You see, she had
            already told me that she knew how to stage houses), but when I saw her reaction
            I knew that Luisa and her experience as a professional designer had already
            exceeded her expectations.

            About two days later my house was listed on the internet.  I had three people
            look at it the first day.  Later that evening my realtor called and said we
            have a young couple wanting to buy your home and they are paying asking price.
            Two days later I had a signed contract.
